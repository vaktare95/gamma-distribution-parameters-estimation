This is my implementation of estimation of two parameters of Gamma distribution - $\alpha$ (shape) and $\theta$ (scale). The estimations of parameters $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are calculated based on equations derived from maximum likelihood estimation (MLE):<br>
$\hat{\theta} = \frac{\overline{X}_n}{\hat{\alpha}}$ , <br>
$\frac{\Gamma\'(\hat{\alpha})}{\Gamma(\hat{\alpha})} - \ln(\hat{\alpha}) - C_n = 0$ , where <br>
